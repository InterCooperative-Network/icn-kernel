# ICN Value Theory & Distribution Model — v0.1

## Core Principle

The ICN recognizes that **contributions are unequal** but **membership is equal**. This document explains how we reconcile market-based value creation with democratic governance, encoding insights from feminist economics about the interdependence of production and social reproduction.

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Dual Nature of Value

**Production Value** (Traditional Economics)
- Created through market activities (goods, services, code)
- Measurable in units (hours, items, quality)
- Exchangeable between parties
- Subject to supply/demand dynamics
- Typically performed in cooperatives

**Reproduction Value** (Feminist Economics)
- Created through social activities (care, culture, governance)
- Often unmeasurable or qualitative
- Embedded in relationships
- Market fails to price appropriately
- Typically performed in communities

### The Interdependence Principle

Neither form of value can exist without the other:
- Production requires healthy, educated, stable workers (reproduction)
- Reproduction requires material resources (production)
- Both are essential for human flourishing
- Neither is inherently superior

## Membership Model

### Equal Rights (Invariant)

Regardless of contribution type or amount:
- **One person, one vote** in all governance
- **Equal access** to propose and participate
- **Equal dignity** in decision-making
- **Equal protection** under network rules

### Differentiated Compensation (Variable)

Based on contribution type and value:
- **Market-discovered** rates for cooperative work
- **Democratically-set** rates for community work
- **Performance-based** adjustments allowed
- **Skill premiums** recognized

### Dual Membership Structure

Most participants hold two memberships:

**Economic Membership** (via Cooperative)
- Where you create economic value
- Determines your wage/revenue share
- Provides professional identity
- Yields production-based tokens

**Social Membership** (via Community)
- Where you live/belong socially
- Determines your services access
- Provides civic identity
- Yields participation opportunities

## Value Distribution Mechanisms

### Within Cooperatives

**Internal Wage Setting** (Democratic but Differentiated)
```
Example Software Coop:
- Senior Developer: 60 tokens/hour
- Junior Developer: 35 tokens/hour  
- Documentation: 40 tokens/hour
- Admin Support: 30 tokens/hour

Process:
1. Wage committee proposes scale
2. Full membership debates
3. One-person-one-vote approval
4. Quarterly review and adjustment
```

**Revenue Distribution**
```
Gross Revenue (1000 tokens)
    ↓
Operating Costs (200 tokens)
    ↓
Federation Levy (100 tokens) → Community Fund
    ↓
Net Revenue (700 tokens)
    ↓
Member Distribution (by hours × wage rate)
```

### Within Communities

**Service Compensation** (Budget-Based)
```
Example Community:
- Childcare: 25 tokens/hour
- Elder Care: 30 tokens/hour
- Education: 35 tokens/hour
- Facilitation: 40 tokens/hour
- Coordination: 35 tokens/hour

Funding Sources:
- Federation transfers (from coop levies)
- Community token issuance (governed)
- Service fees (sliding scale)
- Voluntary contributions
```

**Basic Services Distribution**
```
Community Budget (5000 tokens/month)
    ↓
Essential Services (3000 tokens)
- Healthcare coordinator
- Education programs
- Elder support
    ↓
Participatory Budget (2000 tokens)
- Member proposals
- Democratic allocation
```

## Federation Transfer Mechanism

### The Economic Circuit

```
Cooperatives Generate Surplus
    ↓
Levy Assessment (10-20% typical)
    ↓
Federation Pool
    ↓
Distribution Formula:
- 60% to Communities (per capita)
- 20% to Infrastructure (shared)
- 10% to Emergency Funds
- 10% to Innovation Grants
```

### Levy Justification

Cooperatives benefit from community services:
- Educated workforce (schools)
- Healthy workforce (healthcare)
- Stable workforce (housing/care)
- Coordinated infrastructure (governance)
- Dispute resolution (justice)

Communities depend on cooperative production:
- Material goods
- Technical services
- Economic sustainability
- Innovation capacity
- Trade networks

## Compensation Models

### For Market-Clear Work

**Algorithmic Pricing** (Cooperatives)
```python
wage = base_rate × skill_multiplier × scarcity_factor × performance_score

Where:
- base_rate: Democratically set minimum
- skill_multiplier: 1.0 to 3.0 based on expertise
- scarcity_factor: 0.8 to 1.5 based on supply/demand
- performance_score: 0.9 to 1.1 based on peer review
```

### For Social Work

**Democratic Budgeting** (Communities)
```python
compensation = hourly_rate × hours × quality_factor

Where:
- hourly_rate: Set by community assembly
- hours: Tracked/verified by participants
- quality_factor: 0.9 to 1.1 based on feedback
```

### For Hybrid Work

**Mixed Model** (Both)
```
Example: Teacher at Community School who also tutors privately
- School hours: 30 tokens/hour (community budget)
- Private tutoring: 50 tokens/hour (market rate)
- Same person, same skill, different contexts
- One vote in both community and education coop
```

## Anti-Domination Safeguards

### Preventing Wealth-Based Power

- **Voting weight** never influenced by tokens
- **Wealth caps** prevent extreme accumulation
- **Demurrage** on idle tokens (1-5% monthly)
- **Progressive levies** on high earners
- **Sortition** for key positions

### Preventing Expertise-Based Power

- **Rotation requirements** for specialized roles
- **Documentation requirements** for knowledge sharing
- **Apprenticeship programs** to spread skills
- **Translation requirements** for technical proposals
- **Facilitation training** broadly available

### Preventing Majority Tyranny

- **Minority protections** constitutionally guaranteed
- **Exit rights** with portable assets
- **Fork rights** for fundamental disagreements
- **Veto powers** for affected communities
- **Consensus preference** over simple majority

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Graduate

Joins both:
- **Tech Coop** as junior developer (30 tokens/hour)
- **Neighborhood Community** as resident (5 token/month fee)

Contributes:
- 30 hours/week coding (900 tokens)
- 5 hours/week community garden (voluntary, earns reputation)

### Scenario 3: Dual Contributor

Active in both:
- **Design Coop** as part-time designer (20 hours/week)
- **Arts Community** as part-time teacher (20 hours/week)

Contributes:
- Design work: 20 hrs × 45 tokens = 900 tokens
- Teaching: 20 hrs × 35 tokens = 700 tokens

Receives:
- Mixed income (1600 tokens total)
- Full participation rights in both
- Bridge perspective between economic/social

## Value Metrics
